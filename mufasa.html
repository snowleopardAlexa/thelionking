    <h1>The King of the Pride Rock</h1>
    <p>Mufasa is a major character in Disney's 1994 animated feature film, The Lion King. He was 
    the king of the Pride Lands and the father of Simba. In the midst of his reign, Mufasa was killed
    by his envious brother, Scar, in an effort to steal the throne. Despite his death, Mufasa endures
    in the memories of his loved ones. His spirit manifested in clouds, stars, and sunlight, which has
    occasionally appeared to guide his descendants. Even his grandson Kion he guided him through his
    mishaps and trained him with his Roar of the Elders. </p>
